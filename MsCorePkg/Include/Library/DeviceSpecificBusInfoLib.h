/** @file 
DeviceSpecificBusInfoLib.h

An interface for platforms to define PCI devices which is checked
at boot. Simply create an array of DEVICE_PCI_INFO structures for every
device desired, and an error will be logged if it is not found on the bus. In
cases where the device won't boot to the OS, this can help quickly identify
if the cause is due to a PCI device not being detected.
